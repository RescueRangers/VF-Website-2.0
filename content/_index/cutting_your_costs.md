Vest-Fiber was founded in 2000 by Poul Erik Dokkedal & his brother SÃ¸ren Peter. The company originally sets its goal on small fibre glass products and services to wind turbine industry.

In 2002 our major business partners decided that in house glass fibre cutting was not in their interest anymore and invited VF to take over this task. This led to further development of the company and business growth.

Vest- Fiber has over 15 years of supplying wind energy industry.
