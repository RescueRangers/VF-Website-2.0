[{"categories":null,"contents":"Vest-Fiber was founded year 2000 as a traditional supplier of small fibreglass products and services to the Wind Turbine industry. In 2002 two of our major customers decided, that in-house cutting of Glass reinforcement was not a core business, and Vest-Fiber was invited to focus on cutting competences and acquired equipment and personnel and became a preferred out-sourcing partner. When business is growing the need for focusing on core business, outsourcing and effectiveness will increase. Vest-Fiber has now for over a decade created value to our customers by cutting down their cost. We do this by offering customized kits which can be manufactured in means of cutting, milling or sewing and we pack with labelling and documentation according to our customersâ€™ requests.\n","permalink":"/VF-Website-2.0/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Us"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/VF-Website-2.0/categories/","tags":null,"title":"Categories"},{"categories":null,"contents":"","permalink":"/VF-Website-2.0/contact/","tags":null,"title":"Contact Us"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/VF-Website-2.0/tags/","tags":null,"title":"Tags"},{"categories":null,"contents":null,"permalink":"/VF-Website-2.0/","tags":null,"title":"Vest-Fiber"}]
